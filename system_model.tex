In this chapter, the model of the proposed system is presented.
In the first section, an in-depth presentation of the designed system architecture is provided.
The different components of the system with their functionalities and interactions are described.
Tthe overall architecture was designed in order to build a Software as a Service (SaaS) capable of satisfying different use cases and being used directly by energy retailers.
Lastly, the modules focused on the three use cases of interest are treated more in detail in dedicated sections.
After this chapter, it will be clear what the main parts of the system are and how they cooperate to accomplish the various use cases of interest.


\section{System architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}
\vspace{0.2 cm}

The use case diagram for the proposed system is presented in figure~\ref{fig:usecase}.
Users can interact with the system via dedicated APIs.
To be authorized, a user must be authenticated and have an account with an active subscription.
Users can request the following asynchronous operations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Load new data with a create or update logic specifying the type of data;
  \item Train new models based on available data for a specific use case specifying the time granularity (hourly or daily). The supported specific use cases for the models that will be used in the dedicated forecast requests are electricity demand forecasting, consumption baseline forecasting, and electricity production forecasting;
  \item Forecast future data for a specific use case using a specified model for a certain time granularity, for a certain starting date and time horizon.
\end{itemize}

In addition, a task scheduler periodically triggers the performance evaluation of the available models and if needed triggers the models re-training for having up-to-date models with respect to the user data so that they might perform better on future forecasts.

\caption{The use case diagram for the proposed system.}
\label{fig:usecase}
\end{figure}

For achieving the presented use cases the system architecture shown in figure~\ref{fig:components} was designed.
It is composed of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Authentication layer: manages the authentication process and verifies user permissions;
  \item API layer: manages the user interactions with the system;
  \item Task manager: coordinates the execution of the tasks;
  \item Data loading task: parses and stores the users' loaded data;
  \item ML models interface: handles the interactions with the ML models storage where the trained ML models are stored;
  \item Model training task: trains new models based on available data;
  \item Forecasting task: forecasts future data using a specified model;
  \item Task scheduler: manages the periodic scheduled tasks;
  \item Performance evaluation task: evaluates the performance of the available models and if needed triggers the models re-training.
\end{itemize}

The system interacts with the following external components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users data storage: used to store and retrieve user data, including account data;
  \item Data storage: used to store and retrieve the users' loaded data;
  \item Weather data storage: used to retrieve the weather data;
  \item ML models storage: used to store and retrieve the trained models;
  \item Forecasts storage: used to store and retrieve the computed forecasts.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:interactions} shows the interactions among the components of the designed architecture for achieving the presented use cases.
In the following subsections, the logic for each use case is explained with the relative components' interactions.

\subsection{Data loading}
\label{sec:loading}
\vspace{0.1 cm}

The diagram representing the components' interactions for achieving the data loading use case is presented in figure~\ref{fig:loadinginteractions}.

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/architecture_data_loading_interactions}
\caption{The interactions among the components for achieving the data loading use case.}
\label{fig:loadinginteractions}
\end{figure}

The user sends the data to the system, for example uploading CSV files.
First, the authentication layer verifies the authentication of the user and checks whether it has a subscription to load the data.
The endpoint dedicated to data loading takes charge of the user request and provides the task manager with the details for creating a data loading task.
The identifier of the task is then returned to the user, who can request the status of the data loading request and check the result of the operation when completed.

The data loading task starts when the task manager schedules it.
As shown by the diagram in figure~\ref{fig:loadingflow}, the logic inside this task can be formulated in 2 steps: parse the data and store the data.
The data parser block transforms the user data in a system-compatible format and passes it to the data storage block which stores the data inside the data storage.
If there is no model for the specific use case for which data is loaded, the task manager will also create a model training task to train all the available models on this data.
This allows the system to be ready for the forecast requests on the loaded data.
The model training task is described more in detail in subsection~\ref{sec:training}.

The model training task starts when the task manager schedules it.
As shown by the diagram in figure~\ref{fig:trainingflow}, the logic inside this task can be formulated in 2 steps: preprocess the available data and train the model.
The data preprocessing block collects the available data for the specific use case for which the model will be trained, aggregates it correctly, cleans it, and enriches it with weather data.
The models training module takes the preprocessed data and trains the model with the provided specifications.
It was thought of as an extendable framework on which it is possible to support different models and possibly integrate new ones over time.
The resulting model is then passed to the ML models interface which stores it inside the ML models storage.

In addition to past weather data also weather forecasts are collected to help produce more accurate future data.
The prediction module takes the preprocessed data, requests the specified model, and computes the forecasts.

The data preprocessing block collects the data for the specific use case for which the model will be trained, aggregates it correctly, cleans it, and enriches it with weather data.
The performance evaluation module takes the preprocessed data and evaluates the performance of the last available models.
The performance evaluation procedure with the obtained results is described in chapter~\ref{cha:evaluation}.

\section{System's common components}
\label{sec:components}
\vspace{0.2 cm}

In this section, the system's common components across the various specific use cases are described in detail.

The authentication layer manages the user authentication process.
In particular, for accessing the system the user needs to be authenticated.
When users interact with the system via dedicated APIs, to be authorized they must provide one valid token and have an account with an active subscription.
It is also possible to have more users associated with the same account.

The API layer manages the user interactions with the system.
Many endpoints are available for managing the users' possible operations, such as data loading, model training, and forecasting requests.
Data loading management endpoints consist of requesting the loading of new data and checking the status of the data loading operations.
Model training management endpoints consist of requesting the training of new models and checking the status of the model training operations.
Forecasting requests management endpoints consist of requesting the forecasts of future data and checking the status of the forecasting requests operations.

The task manager coordinates the execution of the different tasks requested by the users.
Where the possible tasks, as described in the previous section, are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data loading task, which parses and stores the users' loaded data on the basis of the type of data;
  \item Model training task, which trains new models based on available data. The specialization of this task for the specific use cases is described in the dedicated sections;
  \item Forecasting task, which forecasts future data using a specified model. The specialization of this task for the specific use cases is described in the dedicated sections.
\end{itemize}

For the data loading task, the main blocks are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data parser, which transforms the input user data in a system-compatible format, the expected information in data depends on the specific use case for which data is loaded;
  \item Data storage, which stores the parsed data inside the data storage with a create or update logic specifying the type of data.
\end{itemize}

The base blocks across the various specific use cases that are then described more in detail in the following sections are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data preprocessing, which retrieves the needed data from the data storage, aggregates it correctly, cleans it by filling the gaps by using a linear interpolation, and enriches it using the weather information retrieved from the weather data storage. For future data forecasts in addition to past weather data also weather forecasts are collected;
  \item Models training module, which takes the preprocessed data and trains the specified model with the provided specifications;
  \item Prediction module, which takes the preprocessed data, requests the specified model, and computes the forecasts.
\end{itemize}

The ML model interface handles the interactions with the ML models storage where the trained ML models are stored.
In particular, this component provides the functionalities to store and retrieve models in the ML models storage,
This component allows the system to support lots of models for each account and new ones can be added over time.
A versioning mechanism is also handled in the model storage.
This component allows the system to provide users with the latest available models and choose the best-performing ones.

The task scheduler manages the periodic scheduled tasks.
In particular, as described in the previous section, it is present just the performance evaluation task, which evaluates the performance of the available models and if needed triggers the models re-training.
The main block of this task is the performance evaluation module, which takes the preprocessed data and evaluates the performance of the last available models using specific use case error metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
