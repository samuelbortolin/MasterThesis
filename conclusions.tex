Ideas for future works ...

% provare a migliorare/pulire dati e usare altre features --> data centric AI
% ensemble learning fatto bene per le combinazioni di modelli per i vari task
% investigate tariff aggregation to understand whether it could be applicable
% improve results on the consumption baseline, maybe trying other models or having more customers find a general models to deal with all of them
% consumption disaggregation
