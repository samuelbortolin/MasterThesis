\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}
\vspace{0.4 cm}

This chapter presents which components of the system and how they have been implemented.
Starting by describing the implementation of the system's common components across the various specific use cases and then explaining the implementation details of the use case-specific modules.
After this chapter, it will be clear how the system was implemented for the testing and validation, which are discussed in the next chapter.


\section{System's common components}
\label{sec:componentsimpl}
\vspace{0.2 cm}

Describe figure~\ref{fig:implementation} ...

Describe the implementation of the system's common components ...
\begin{itemize}
  \item ML model interface: interface with MLflow using Python client;
  \item Model training task: trains new models based on available data;
  \item Forecasting task: forecasts future data using a specified model.
\end{itemize}

The system interacts with the following external components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data DB: InfluxDB or stored as CSV file;
  \item Weather Data DB: InfluxDB or stored as CSV file;
  \item ML models storage: MLflow or stored as pickle file;
  \item Forecasts DB: InfluxDB or stored as CSV file.
\end{itemize}
